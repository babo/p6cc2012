## Things that might be good to know

I'd rather not go changing the `description` and `base-test` files
after having released them, but sometimes new information turns up.
This is where I'll put it.

* People inform me that the correct way to phrase the error message
  in the t1 base test is "*of* the form", not "*on* the form". I
  guess they're right. A spec is a spec, though, so the base test
  is what counts.

* If you feel that apostrophes (such as the ones in "it's" or "we'd")
  should really be allowed in the t2 haikus, you're free to use them.
  Either change the base test yourself, or ignore the fact that it
  sometimes disqualifies your haikus. All other non-alphabetics are
  still disallowed.
